### Space Number

This project is heavily inspired by [Whichspace](https://github.com/gechr/WhichSpace) <br/>

Main idea behind making another Desktop Space App
1. I keep my menu hidden so there is no way for me to know which desktop number I'm in
2. I don't wanna open my menu bar to just check it
3. So I made by taking the code from WhichSpace and adding the feature

Hope, you like it!
